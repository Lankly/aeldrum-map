# Aeldrum Map

This is a map for my D&D group's Sci-Fi setting. The roads between planets are non-Euclidean and thus cannot normally be represented on paper. This project attempts to give a "subway"-style map of the setting. Check it out at https://aeldrum-map.neocities.org/! (Requires a modern browser)
